Sentiment Analysis Project 1
1. The Hotel Review Dataset was downloaded from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datafiniti/hotel-reviews
2. This dataset originally contains a total of 10,000 entries of customers' reviews on different hotels that they stayed, however, only 5 points or 1 point of reviews were kept for analysis
3. The purpose of this NLP project is to perform a sentiment analysis to decide if a review is positive (rated as 5 points) or negative (rated as 1 point)
